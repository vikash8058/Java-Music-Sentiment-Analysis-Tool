# Java-Music-Sentiment-Analysis-Tool
The Music Sentiment Analysis Tool is a Java-based program that analyzes an MP3 file’s audio properties—pitch, tempo, and loudness—to determine its mood (e.g., Happy, Sad, or Calm). It allows users to select an MP3 file, converts it to WAV and then extracts key audio features using TarsosDSP. The extracted values are processed through simple rules to classify the mood of the music, and the result is displayed in the console. The project leverages Java Swing for file selection, JLayer (javazoom) for MP3 conversion, and TarsosDSP for audio processing, offering a simple yet effective approach to sentiment analysis without using deep learning.
